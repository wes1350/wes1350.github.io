# About

I'm Wesley. My interests include languages, cooking, chess, programming, and writing.

## This Blog

I have a few primary goals for this blog:

- Explain concrete topics I'm familiar with
    - [Posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link posts.md %})
- Express thoughts on less concrete topics
    - [Essays]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link essays/index.md %}) and [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link notes/index.md %})
- Highlight resources I've found helpful or interesting
    - [Recommendations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link misc/recommendations/index.md %})
- Get feedback, refinements, and extensions for things I post
