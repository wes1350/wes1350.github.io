# Sitting in Silence

Why is silence so awkward?

It's weird for me to think about how universally silence is perceived as awkward (at least in American society; I'm not sure how much this applies to other cultures.) For some reason, almost everyone I see, including me, seems to have this urge to limit silence as much as possible. I don't remember being taught this feeling, but for some reason, it's something I feel deeply, and I have little insight as to why this is the case.

This feeling arises regardless of whether I'm talking with one person or a large group. Interestingly I think the feeling gets somewhat stronger with larger groups, but there are more people around to break the silence, which makes things easier.

Sometimes I cringe a bit inside when it becomes painfully obvious that people are talking just to break the silence -- including when I catch myself doing it. Some people give in faster than others and say arbitrary things that may not make any sense; others will strategize a bit and try to refer back to a previous topic, or maybe ask a random question about someone in the group ("Did you just get a haircut?"); some even laugh things off and directly address the awkward silence itself (this one I dislike the most); probably everyone at times resorts to external stimuli or excuses ("Need to reply to this text", "Whoops, I'm late for something", etc.)

Sometimes, if I can bear it, I'll try to extend the silence just to see what happens. Who will break first? What will they say? I have a feeling that how people behave in such situations can give you some sliver of insight into their personality. In fact, I remember hearing about some people exploiting this tendency in others to avoid silence; for example, negotiators seeking to get the other party to cave, or powerful people looking to get others to compromise on something (I can't remember any concrete examples, unfortunately.)

### An Experiment

"Experiment" is a bit of a misnomer, but I have had for some time the idea of getting a group of people -- probably around 5 or 6 is ideal, although many sizes could work, really -- and forcing ourselves to sit in silence for a decent, but not excessive, period of time - maybe 20 minutes or so. No communication -- no hand signals, no funny faces, no staring contests, no winks, no nothing. No external influences -- no phones, no food to play with, no books to read, no windows to look out of -- nothing. No meditation either -- this should be a time of nothingness, where *nobody* is doing *anything*. There's no agenda or topic to think about. I want people to embrace the silence and just be together without any obligation of interaction, and further, an *absence* of interaction, without any distractions to divert our attention. Just *be*. Can we generate something resembling an awkward silence and embrace it? Can we feel the seconds stretch into minutes, and the minutes blend together?

I have the feeling that forced silence won't feel as awkward, because it removes that element of unexpectedness -- of clumsiness -- that accompanies a normal lull in conversation. It will undoubtedly feel a *bit* odd though, don't you think?

Will I ever get to conduct this experiment? Probably not, honestly. First, why would people want to do this? It's something I'm curious about, but I doubt many others would be. I can't offer a question I'm trying to answer, or a problem I'm trying to solve, through this little experiment. I think most people would find it a waste of time.

Second, I think it's something that many people, perhaps myself included, would feel uncomfortable doing, just because of the lack of stimulation. I think I've shot my attention span to some degree through nearly constant stimulation: music, social media, games, etc. I would also wager that plenty of people would fare even worse. While I may be fine, since I can pretty easily get lost in my own head, I feel like many people would get feel pretty uncomfortable sitting *by themselves* with no external stimulation. Compounding that with the presence of others and the inability to interact with them may be a bit too unnatural for some, even if only for 20 minutes. 

If you can find a group of people willing to do this, and you can have them meet me in person some day, let me know.
