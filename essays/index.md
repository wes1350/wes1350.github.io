# Essays and Shorts

More is coming soon!

## Essays

Essays, in contrast to posts, are more personal or speculative, and generally far less concrete. Don't take them too seriously -- I think of them like more detailed, thought-out versions of things I would say in conversations.

## Shorts

Shorts are thoughts that aren't as well thought-out as essays, but perhaps worthy of posting regardless. Though I don't currently use Twitter, maybe some of them would be things I would post there if I did.
