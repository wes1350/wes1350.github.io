# Generalizing Natural Selection

You are surely familiar with *natural selection*, the process by which organisms with different traits experience different rates of survival and reproduction, as a result of their respective traits. Originally proposed by Charles Darwin, it serves as a key mechanism for the process of evolution, which gave rise to the vast array of different organisms we see today.

My first exposure to the idea that natural selection is not exclusive to biology, but instead a specific realization of a more general principle, came from reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) about 10 years ago. In the book, he coined the idea of *memes*, which, roughly, are gene-like units of human culture which, according to their specific properties, have differential rates of survival and reproduction. Memes (in their original sense, *not* in the sense they carry today, of Internet memes) are a powerful concept, so let's delve into them a bit further.

## Properties of Cultural Memes

A meme, as I interpret it, is just an individual unit present in human culture, like a tune or traditional custom. Like genes, memes generally function as individual units, though generally composed of constituent parts; the notes of a tune, which can be considered a meme, mirror the nucleotides of a gene, for example. Similarly, as with genes, memes are not always a precise concept. It can be a matter of definition whether a particular song is a meme, or instead a collection of memes often linked together. We don't need to be so precise here; the general properties of memes (or strongly associated groups of memes) matter much more.

Continuing the comparison with genes, memes can evolve; a gene's "code" can change through the substitution, addition, or deletion of nucleotides, while a meme's "code" can change through the alteration, addition, or deletion of components, like the notes in a tune. While memes are not replicated directly through the formation of biological offspring, memes are propogated throughout a population through communication. For example, a simple myth could be considered a meme, which can be propagated through a community, or even a civilization, if it is communicated within the population enough.

There are many ideas and cultural phenomena we could consider to be memes; we already mentioned tunes and myths, but more granular ideas like the belief in a form of eternal punishment (as Dawkins mentioned in *The Selfish Gene*) can also be considered memes. Even Internet memes, the most common usage of the word *meme* these days, are memes, in the cultural sense. While harder to precisely define than a gene, we can think of memes generally as individual components of human culture.

## Cultural Selection

With natural selection, genes which benefit the survival and reproduction of an organism will tend to become more prevalent in a population. This is not due to any form of "intent" on behalf of the gene, but is just a natural consequence of specific entities having an advantage over others. 

Just like natural selection governs the process of biological evolution, *cultural selection* governs the process of human cultural evolution. Specific ideas, or memes, if they have characteristics that are advantageous for surviving and propagating within a population, will tend to become more prevalent within a population over time. This can occur without any conscious effort on behalf of the people involved. Reproduction, in the cultural sense, is achieved through transmission; ideas which people want to spread naturally become more prevalent than those that don't. Survival of a cultural meme entails some degree of durability, or even permanence. The more impactful or memorable an idea is, the longer it will survive within the mind of its holder -- all the better if it is an idea which lends itself to widespread transmission.

Cultural memes, just like genes, can die out, through the cessation of the cycle of survival and reproduction. When an organism dies, the physical manifestation of its particular genes die out, although if the organism has reproduced, copies of its genes will live on in other organisms. The same applies to cultural memes; when a person carrying a meme dies, or when the meme dies (i.e. is forgotten) inside a person's mind, the concrete manifestation of that meme, concerning that person, ceases to exist. Of course, if the person has transmitted that meme to others, then the meme will live on in their minds. Furthermore, as ideas are often transmitted imperfectly, the surviving (or "offspring") memes will often have some variation, leading to a diversity in characteristics. Just as in natural selection, those variants which lend themselves the most to transmission and propagation can be expected to become the most prevalent in the population.

A song, for instance, can be "catchy", an excellent trait to have for survival, in the sense of lasting longer in peoples' minds. If people are embarrassed by the song, they will tend to hesitate to propogate it, and we should generally expect it to not propagate too far in the population. On the other hand, if it nicely fits the bill of a radio hit, we can expect it to reach a significant chunk of the population. In such a situation, the song will experience high rates of reproduction (through transmission) and survival (through catchiness), making it far more commonly encountered than songs lacking either of those traits.

I must stress that the similarities between genes and memes are not infinite. Genes, unlike memes, can last millions of years (well, in theory, I suppose memes could too.) Genes are bound to rules of biology that memes are not; memes are bound to rules of human thought that genes are not. The reason why genes and memes share so many similarities is because they share fundamental properties with each other, and exist in specific environments that share other fundamental properties. Naturally, where these properties differ, so do genes and memes diverge in behavior and characteristics.
