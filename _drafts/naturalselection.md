# Generalizing Natural Selection

*Natural selection* is the process by which organisms with different traits experience different rates of survival and reproduction, as a result of their respective traits. Originally proposed by Charles Darwin, it serves as a key mechanism for the process of evolution, which gave rise to the vast array of different organisms we see today.

My first exposure to the idea that natural selection is not exclusive to biology, but instead a specific realization of a more general principle, came from reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) about 10 years ago. In the book, he coined the idea of *memes*, which, roughly, are gene-like units of human culture which, according to their specific properties, have differential rates of survival and reproduction. Examples of *memes* include songs and abstract concepts (like belief in an afterlife).
