# Generalizing Natural Selection

You are surely familiar with *natural selection*, the process by which organisms with different traits experience different rates of survival and reproduction, as a result of their respective traits. Originally proposed by Charles Darwin, it serves as a key mechanism for the process of evolution, which gave rise to the vast array of different organisms we see today.

My first exposure to the idea that natural selection is not exclusive to biology, but instead a specific realization of a more general principle, came from reading [The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) about 10 years ago. In the book, he coined the idea of *memes*, which, roughly, are gene-like units of human culture which, according to their specific properties, have differential rates of survival and reproduction. Memes (in their original sense, *not* in the sense they carry today, of Internet memes) are a powerful concept, so let's delve into them a bit further.

## Properties of Cultural Memes

A meme, as I interpret it, is just an individual unit present in human culture, like a tune or traditional custom. Like genes, memes generally function as individual units, though generally composed of constituent parts; the notes of a tune, which can be considered a meme, mirror the nucleotides of a gene, for example. Similarly, as with genes, memes are not always a precise concept. It can be a matter of definition whether a particular song is a meme, or instead a collection of memes often linked together. We don't need to be so precise here; the general properties of memes (or strongly associated groups of memes) matter much more.

Continuing the comparison with genes, memes can evolve; a gene's "code" can change through the substitution, addition, or deletion of nucleotides, while a meme's "code" can change through the alteration, addition, or deletion of components, like the notes in a tune. While memes are not replicated directly through the formation of biological offspring, memes are propogated throughout a population through communication. For example, a simple myth could be considered a meme, which can be propagated through a community, or even a civilization, if it is communicated within the population enough.

There are many ideas and cultural phenomena we could consider to be memes; we already mentioned tunes and myths, but more granular ideas like the belief in a form of eternal punishment (as Dawkins mentioned in *The Selfish Gene*) can also be considered memes. Even Internet memes, the most common usage of the word *meme* these days, are memes, in the cultural sense. While harder to precisely define than a gene, we can think of memes generally as individual instances of human culture.
