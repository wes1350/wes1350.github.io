# Personal Completeness

I've been grappling recently with the idea of *personal completeness*. Personal completeness is perhaps better defined by being the opposite of *personal incompleteness*, which is the lack of something -- a skill, some knowledge, or an experience -- that would significantly improve you as a person, whether by giving you an extremely useful skill, or by widening your worldview, or something similar. Personal completeness is a very general concept, and only applies to things that are relatively general, that are largely accessible to most people given enough determination. It is also a very *subjective* concept, and my conception of personal completeness is entirely informed by my worldview, my priorities, and what I see as valuable; I imagine yours would look a bit different.

The idea of personal completeness originates largely from the things I want to do in my life, but is partially inspired by the following quote, which I've seen on occasion: 

> A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
> > Robert Heinlein, *Time Enough For Love*

This list is too unspecific for my tastes, and has skills I think are largely useless. My list, for the moment, is as follows.

### General Life Skills

### Speak a Foreign Language

### Live in a Foreign Country

### Understand Historical Context

### Play an Instrument

### Experience with Guns

### Physical Fitness

### Create a Product
