# Dominant Cultural Ideas

*Read [Generalizing Natural Selection]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _drafts/naturalselection.md %}) first*

I would like to start with a few disclaimers. 

First, essentially *everything* in this article is a matter of speculation; I will attempt to offer explanations for certain common cultural phenomena by the influence of cultural selection, but there is nothing inherently concrete behind anything written here.  

Second, my goal is to approach each cultural phenomenon as neutrally and objectively as possible, without giving any form of judgment on its morality or correctness.

Lastly, as the word "meme" is now nearly universally used in the sense of Internet memes, I will avoid using it here in order to avoid confusion. Instead, I will use "idea" or similar terms, depending on the context.

With that being said, a *dominant cultural idea*, as I refer to it here, is an idea (i.e. meme) which, by the characteristics it has in incentivizing its own survival and reproduction, has become commonplace within some portion of human society. A dominant cultural idea is the cultural equivalent of a gene which, through its utility in aiding the organisms containing it to survive and reproduce, has become commonplace within a population of organisms. I believe there are a number of dominant culutral ideas commonly found, or sometimes even universally present, within human society. The first part of this essay will talk about properties of these dominant cultural ideas, the latter part will focus on a few of these specific instances of dominant cultural ideas.

## The Interplay Between Human Genetics and Culture

As I mentioned in *Generalizing Natural Selection*, culture and genetics exist in two completely different realms, and do not necessarily affect each other. For example, plenty of genes exist which have no effect on human cognition (the space of culture and ideas), and plenty of ideas exist with no effect no survival or reproduction (the space of genetic propagation). The fact that an idea is widespread within a population of humans doesn't mean it has any positive influence on the survival or reproduction of the individuals within the population; it only means that the existing cognitive and cultural machinery available to the population facilitated the idea's propagation within the population. 

In fact, an idea can spread within a population even while *harming* each individual's ability to survive and reproduce in a biological sense, as long as the cognitive environment it finds itself in lends itself well to the idea's survival and propagation within the population. A good example of this, which Dawkins mentions in *The Selfish Gene*, is the idea of *celibacy*; despite completely eliminating the possibility of biological reproduction, the idea of *celibacy* can spread within a certain population (e.g. of priests) if the population is receptive to it, and especially so if it carries an advantage over other ideas. If a priest's duties are best fulfilled through the practice of celibacy, and others take on the practice to follow the priest's example (among other mechanisms of propagation of this idea), then the practice of celibacy will spread throughout the population.

Of course, some ideas *do* have positive benefits regarding biological survival and reproduction, and eventually become widespread. The observation of sanitary practices (whether with the intention ofimproving sanitation or not) will improve the chances of survival for individuals, resulting in a positive selection pressure towards individuals who practice superior sanitation. If these individuals spread these practices to their families (among others), we can expect that after several generations, these sanitary practices will become increasingly widespread.

Other ideas have such a negative influence on survival that they tend to disappear almost as quickly as they emerge, as their owners become unable to spread it, whether as a result of death or other means. Suicide, from an evolutionary perspective, is probably a good example of this: individuals who commit suicide are no longer able to (directly) convince others to follow suit. Suicide itself is an idea that can certainly spread throughout a population, perhaps even widely, as seen in the emergence of various suicide cults; yet, as a virus too deadly for its own good, the idea kills its own hosts, and thus ceases to propagate too far within society.

---- need to elaborate on this
An interesting consequence of this is the possibility of higher-order interactions between genetics and culture. A gene may experience positive selection pressure even if it itself does not lend any benefit to survival and reproduction, or even if it confers a *negative* impact, if it sufficiently encourages the adoption of ideas or cultural elements that *do* benefit its survival and propagation within the population.

## Specific Dominant Cultural Ideas

### Patriotism

Patriotism seems to be a prime candidate for an example of a dominant cultural idea, in my eyes. I conjecture that patriotism often has a positive influence on the development and survival of societies; those with a patriotic sense of pride in their country will seek to support and contribute to it, leading to improvement in the country over time, further reinforcing patriotic feelings. A country devoid of patriotic citizens will be disadvantaged, in the sense that few will be willing to contribute to its continued survival. Such a country may experience high emigration, if its citizens would prefer living elsewhere, resulting in fewer people investing in the future of the country.

Interestingly, upon being taken to its nationalistic extremes, patriotism can become a very dangerous belief for a society to possess in great numbers. A strongly nationalistic society may think itself superior to others, leading to a variety of potentially serious negative consequences. One is the appetite for war or conquest, often against supposedly "inferior" peoples, which, if done recklessly, can lead to the society's destruction through militaristic means. Another is the stringent closing of borders and restriction of trade, which can result in reduced technological innovation and exposure, leading to potential economic collapse or, again, risk of defeat through militaristic means by a technomologically superior society. 


## Conclusion...

A dominant cultural idea isn't necessarily *good*: it is just prominent. While many dominant cultural ideas carry survival benefits in the reproductive sense, whether on the level of individuals or entire societies, it is sufficient to just be an idea that is consistently spread within a population to be a dominant cultural idea, regardless of the actual benefit to the individuals holding the idea.
