# We Need More Long-Form Content

I wish we spent more time with long-form (non-entertainment) content. By "content", I mean both consumption (reading longer articles, listening to long-form podcasts, engaging with complex ideas, etc.) and production (writing nuanced opinions, having deeper conversations, etc.) 

I don't have any specific problems I'm trying to solve with this, but I think it would do some good for the world. In a world of scrolling through endless feeds, watching TikTok after TikTok, constant notifications, and endless other means of electronic stimulation, I worry that we are gradually losing our ability to think deeply about things. When headlines and short clips are all we see, do we fail to understand the nuance of reality?

Short-form content is easy, fun, and efficient. It definitely has its upsides, and deserves a place in this world. Unfortunately, I spend too much time with it, and you probably too do. I think we need to fight against the current and do our best to engage more deeply with things.
