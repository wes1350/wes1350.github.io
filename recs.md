A collection of resources I've found interesting, useful, and insightful.

### Cooking, Food

- [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com), a phenomenal resource for recipes, techniques, equipment, and in-depth information about the science and "inner workings" of cooking. I trust this website more than anything else when it comes to cooking.
    - Examples of articles I've used myself (each article has an accompanying recipe):
        - [The Science of the Best Fresh Pasta](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html)
        - [The Food Lab's Complete Guide to Sous Vide Burgers](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/08/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-burger.html)
        - [The Pizza Lab: Foolproof Pan Pizza](https://slice.seriouseats.com/2013/01/the-pizza-lab-the-worlds-easiest-pizza-no-knead-no-stretch-pan-pizza.html)

### Podcasts

- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), a podcast featuring many prominent guests, with a focus on topics related to Artificial Intelligence, though there's plenty of interesting content for those uninterested in AI. 
    - Some episodes I enjoyed:
        - [#117 Sheldon Solomon: Death and Meaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfKyNxfyWbo&t=1144s&ab_channel=LexFridman)
        - [#63 Stephen Kotkin: Stalin, Putin, and the Nature of Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCkkjnpS2f8&ab_channel=LexFridman)
        - [#20 Oriol Vinyals: DeepMind AlphaStar, StarCraft, Language, and Sequences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kedt2or9xlo&ab_channel=LexFridman)
- [Inner French Podcast](https://innerfrench.com/), a podcast, completely in French, geared towards intermediate-level French learners, discussing a variety of interesting topics. 

### Programming, Computer Science

- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu), a series of classes freely available online, intended for filling in gaps in knowledge for CS (Computer Science) students.
