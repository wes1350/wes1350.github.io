A collection of resources I've found interesting, useful, and insightful.

### Podcasts

- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), a podcast featuring many prominent guests, with a focus on topics related to Artificial Intelligence, though there's plenty of interesting content for those uninterested in AI. 

- [Inner French Podcast](https://innerfrench.com/), a podcast, completely in French, geared towards intermediate-level French learners, discussing a variety of interesting topics. 

### Programming, Computer Science

- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](missing.csail.mit.edu), a series of classes freely available online, intended for filling in gaps in knowledge for CS (Computer Science) students.
