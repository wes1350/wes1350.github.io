# Cooking, Food

- [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com): a phenomenal resource for recipes, techniques, equipment, and in-depth information about the science and "inner workings" of cooking.
    - Examples of articles I've used myself (each article has an accompanying recipe):
        - [The Science of the Best Fresh Pasta](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html)
        - [The Food Lab's Complete Guide to Sous Vide Burgers](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/08/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-burger.html)
        - [The Pizza Lab: Foolproof Pan Pizza](https://slice.seriouseats.com/2013/01/the-pizza-lab-the-worlds-easiest-pizza-no-knead-no-stretch-pan-pizza.html)
- [The Food Lab](http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/): an award-winning book written by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, a major contributor to Serious Eats. There is a lot of overlap between The Food Lab and Serious Eats.
- [Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com): a great book (and, later, a Netflix series) on four essential elements of cooking. Great for getting a deeper understanding of how cooking works, in terms of simple, general principles.
