# Media

On this page I recommend various media I think are interesting, insightful, or useful.

**This is not an endorsement of all the views expressed in the media mentioned here.** However, I have found some value in everything mentioned here.

### Blogs

- [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/all-the-posts-since-the-beginning-of-time/): a blog written by "Mr. Money Mustache", who retired at 30 through aggressive saving and living very frugally. I've read essentially every post here, and although some may not like his style, I think there's a lot of good advice here which can apply to nearly everyone. His lifestyle is "extreme" to many people (including me), but taking a small portion of the advice should go a long way for many.
    - [The True Cost of Commuting](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/10/06/the-true-cost-of-commuting/): one of the articles that has stuck with me the most since reading it.

### Podcasts

- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/): a podcast featuring many prominent guests, with a focus on topics related to Artificial Intelligence, though there's plenty of interesting content for those uninterested in AI.
