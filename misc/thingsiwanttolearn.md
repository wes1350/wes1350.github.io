# Things I Want to Learn

Some of these items are really general, others more specific. Usually, the more general something is, the less I know about it. Hopefully, as I tackle these various fields, I'll be able to list more specific subfields that I find most interesting.

This is an open invitation to contact me if you have any advice or resources (e.g. books) you have regarding these subjects.

\* = I really want to learn this. \
\*\* = I want to know this, but it's not the end of the world if I don't. \
\*\*\* = If I have a lot of extra time someday, it would be cool to learn this.

### Art
- \* **Visual art**: I want a moderate understanding of how to draw or paint at a decent level. Just being able to quickly and accurately sketch people would be a great start.

### Computer Science / Programming
- \* **C++**: Seems like a must-know language, at least to a moderate level.
- \* **Functional programming**: I've never dealt with a functional language before, and understanding how functional programming works seems like a worthy pursuit.
- \* **Neural Networks**: I studied machine learning at university, but still don't have much experience actually creating NN's and using on problems I am personally interested in. 
- \*\* **Cryptography**: I care less about the most precise mathematical formulations, and more about the practical applications. It's use with security and now cryptocurrency make it seem like a good field to know something about.
    - \*\* Related: **How cryptocurrencies work**, at a deeper level.

### Games
- \*\* **Chess**: Whatever knowledge it takes to get to FIDE Master (I've been sitting around 1800-1900 or so for a long time.)
- \*\*\* **Poker**: A very vague goal, but poker is beautiful, and I'd love to get a fundamental understanding of higher-level play: constructing dedicated ranges and how to think deeply about spots, and feel like I generally know what to do at any point.

### History
- \* **U.S. History**: A deeper understanding of U.S. history would go a long way towards being able to understand how to navigate our current political and social climate. 
- \* **World War II**: Same as with US history.

### Languages 
- \* **Japanese (conversational)**: So I can have conversations with the other half of my family.
- \*\* **Italian (conversational)**: it's cool, easy enough for English speakers, and even easier if you know other Romance languages.
- \*\* **Portuguese (conversational)**: also cool, easy enough for English speakers, and even easier if you know other Romance languages.

### Math
- \* **Statistics**: Somehow, even after taking a number of stats courses during university, I somehow still feel like I don't know anything.
- \*\* **Complex Analysis**: I don't know, complex numbers seem pretty fundamental, and I learned surprisingly little about how they work during university.

### Music
- \* **Piano**: For now, I can only poorly imitate my way through a couple moderately difficult pieces through rote memorization. It would be great to actually be able to play music with a solid foundation.
- \*\* **Guitar**: I'm slightly better here than piano right now, but again, little foundation besides some basic chords.

### Natural Sciences
- \*\*\* **Special Relativity**: I feel like you need this to really understand how stuff works around here.
- \*\*\* **General Relativity**: I feel like you need this to really understand how stuff works around here, but this might be too hard.

### Photography
- \* **Fundamentals of Photography**: How to take decent photos in general. How to (somewhat) optimize composition, lighting, and all the 91483 camera settings.
- \*\* **Photo Editing**: How to use programs like Photoshop and Lightroom (or equivalent programs) to achieve what I want.

### Political Science
- \* **Political Ideologies**: For now, I have only a basic understanding of the most influential political ideologies and the history behind their development and usage.
