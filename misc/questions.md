# Questions

Random questions, mostly inconsequential, that I'm curious about.

- Are there many people with persistent but minor health problems attributable to entirely avoidable slight food intolerances?
- What would happen to society if gender ratios at birth suddenly became skewed (2:1 or more in either direction)?
- Does the first letter of a child's name affect their development (e.g. by always being called on early or late in class)?
